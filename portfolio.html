    <h2>Our project makes 3 different shapes and puts them inside of each other. 
	    We used either brute force of a series of nested loops to create these shapes. 
	    Our 3 shapes are a square, hexagon, and diamond. 
	    I personally made the diamond with 3 nested loops.

	 <h2>The Second project i worked on made an interactable with tic tac toe grid. I personally did the logic statements and drew the 3x3 grid,
		 While my partners added the blackout and drew the shapes we faced many challenges including using a leaderboard function.
		 The all around cleanliness made this a very fun project to work on!
